Cloning a repository
The simplest way to connect to a git repository on github is to clone an existing repository. You can create an empty repository on github and the clone a copy onto your computer. You can also clone an existing repository as long as it is public. You will only be allowed to push changes into it if you have been set as a collaborator on that project, but you can always pull down the latest changes that others have made. If your username is USER and your repository name is REPO then clone command is

git clone https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
Pushing a repository into github
If you already have a folder you want to push into github, you do the following

initialize the repository with git init . as above
create a .gitignore specifying which files you do not want pushed into the repository
add the files to the repository with git add .
commit those files to the repository with git commit -m "first commit"
create a repository REPO on github
set the REPO as a remote repository for your folder with git remote add origin https://github.com/USER/REPO.git
pull the repository to your folder with git pull origin main
push your changes to the cloud with git push origin main
