r - reading a file
w -writing to a file (i.e. modifiying it)
x - running a file as a program or script
You can do this separately for the
u = user
g = group (defined in /etc/groups)
o = everybody on the system


The easiest way to set commands is using the "chmod" command

Linux allows you to switch between user accounts if you know the password. You use the su (substitute user) command with the -l switch

su -l USERNAME -- switches to another user account

There is a distinguished user on a Linux system called the superuser that owns the process that starts the entire system. You are generally not allowed to use su to be come the superuser, but if you are on the list of "sudoers" (/etc/sudoers) you can run a command as superuser using sudo

sudo COMMANDS -- runs the commands as the superuser
If you own a file, you can change the owner and change the group using the chown and chgrp commands. You can also change the password using the passwd command.
